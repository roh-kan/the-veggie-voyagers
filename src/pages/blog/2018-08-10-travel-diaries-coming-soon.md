Bali, land of temples or the land of tourists from all parts of the world. There are infinite metaphors which can be attached with Bali and it really deserves all of them.

The best thing that captures your imagination is the variety of the climate from hot and humid in the south to the soothing greenery of Ubud to the scenic beauty of north. All you get in a single piece of land.

## Things to remember

Here are few things that you can take note of before heading to Bali:

1. All the temples charge an entry fee. All temples provide sarong free of charge. So, no worries if you are wearing shorts.
2. It is always advisable to carry an umbrella with you but keep in mind you can get umbrellas for rent outside all major tourist attractions.
3. Toilets are everywhere but they charge at least 2k.
4. Tirta Empul temple market gives you the best rate for buying touristy stuff. Bargain is the only mantra that you need to keep in mind while shopping. For instance, in the Ubud market, final price can go down to 10% of the first quoted price.
5. You can negotiate the prices to 20–30% of the actual price of the listed water sports prices. You wont believe but do give it a try. It works.
6. Fruits are a highlight. You can get fresh fruits (oranges directly from farm) in every nuke and corner of Bali.
7. If you want to get general items, there are super marts in every 2–3kms. So, don't worry if you want to grab snack or drinks while you are visiting places.
8. Book a driver in advance. Keep your itinerary ready. Places are quite far.
